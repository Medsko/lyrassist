/**
 * Endpoints for 'prompt mode'. In prompt mode, two or more sets of randomized words are presented. The user/lyricist
 * can then make unexpected combinations, which ideally get the creative juices flowing.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *      - write           cushion
 *      - prescribe       sunlight
 *      - wait            window
 *      - listen          drum
 *
 * Could result in something like:
 *
 *      the drum is waiting
 *      by the window listening
 *      where the sunlight writes
 *      on the cushions
 *      prescribed
 *
 *      (from How to write one song, by Jeff Tweedy, 2020)
